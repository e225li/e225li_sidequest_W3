## Description

This p5.js project demonstrates a simple multi-screen game structure using a state-based approach. The sketch includes a start screen, an instructions screen with a back button, a basic game screen, and win/lose outcome screens. The focus is on showing how to separate screens into different files, route input based on the current game state, and design simple UI elements such as buttons and keyboard controls. It also reflects on the idea of player-choice having an influence on the narrative of the game.

## Learning Goals

- Understand how to manage multiple game states using a shared currentScreen variable
- Practice separating code across multiple files for readability and maintenance
- Implement clickable and keyboard-accessible UI buttons
- Learn how to route draw(), mousePressed(), and keyPressed() logic based on the active screen
- Build a basic instructions screen with a functional back button

The code was written by Ella Li but I used GenAI to write the comments and build ideas for the game and create basic coding lines to help start the process.
